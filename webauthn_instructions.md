I am unable to add the `laragear/webauthn` package to your project directly. Please run the following commands to install and configure it:

1.  `composer require laragear/webauthn`
2.  `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=webauthn-config`

Once you have done this, I will continue with the implementation of the WebAuthn functionality.
