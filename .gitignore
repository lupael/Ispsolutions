# Build assets are now tracked for deployment
# NOTE: Typically, build artifacts should be generated during deployment via CI/CD.
# However, this project tracks built assets for simpler deployment scenarios where
# build pipelines are not available. For production deployments with CI/CD, consider
# uncommenting the line below and running 'npm run build' as part of the deployment process.
