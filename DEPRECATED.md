## ✅ New in v3.2: Deprecated Code Removal

The following deprecated code has been removed in v3.2:

### Removed Deprecated Methods
- ✅ **NotificationService::sendInvoiceGenerated()** - Removed (replaced by sendInvoiceGeneratedNotification)
- ✅ **NotificationService::sendPaymentReceived()** - Removed (replaced by sendPaymentReceivedNotification)
- ✅ **AdminController::mikrotikRouters()** - Removed (replaced by routers() at panel.admin.network.routers)
- ✅ **AdminController::oltDevices()** - Removed (replaced by oltList() at panel.admin.network.olt)

### Maintained for Backward Compatibility
- ⚠️ **User::networkUser()** relationship - Kept for backward compatibility (heavily used throughout codebase)
  - While network credentials are now stored directly on User model, the NetworkUser relationship is still actively used in many controllers, exports, and accessors
  - Cannot be removed without major refactoring

---

## ✅ New in v3.1: Role System Documentation

The role system has been completely updated and consolidated in v3.1:

### Primary Role System Documentation
- ✅ **[ROLE_SYSTEM.md](ROLE_SYSTEM.md)** - **NEW** Complete role system specification v3.1
  - Comprehensive role hierarchy (levels 0-100)
  - Tenancy creation rules
  - Resource and billing responsibilities
  - Demo accounts and seeding guide
  - Implementation details

### Deprecated Role Documentation
The following role-related files are now **deprecated** and replaced by ROLE_SYSTEM.md:

| Old File | Status | Replacement |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **ROLE_HIERARCHY_CLARIFICATION.md** | ⚠️ Deprecated | ROLE_SYSTEM.md |
| **ROLE_HIERARCHY_IMPLEMENTATION.md** | ⚠️ Deprecated | ROLE_SYSTEM.md |
| **ROLE_SYSTEM_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** | ⚠️ Deprecated | ROLE_SYSTEM.md |
| **SUMMARY.md** | ⚠️ Deprecated | ROLE_SYSTEM.md |
| **DATA_ISOLATION.md** | ⚠️ Keep for now | See also ROLE_SYSTEM.md |
| **docs/PR1_TENANCY_AND_ROLES.md** | ⚠️ Deprecated | ROLE_SYSTEM.md |

**Migration Path**: Use **[ROLE_SYSTEM.md](ROLE_SYSTEM.md)** for all role system documentation.

## Consolidated Documentation

The following files have been consolidated into comprehensive guides. They are marked for future removal after a transition period.

### API Documentation → `docs/API.md`

The following files have been merged into the unified **[API Documentation](docs/API.md)**:

| Old File | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md** | ⚠️ Deprecated | All content merged into docs/API.md |

**Migration Path**: Use `docs/API.md` as the single source of truth for all API documentation.
